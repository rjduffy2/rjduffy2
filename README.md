I have an "obselete" 2009 Mac Pro Tower (i.e. an unsuported Mac) and I would like to upgrade my OS to the laterst version that it can handle without issues. Specifically I would like to go to Monterey. I have viewed some videos on Open Core Legay Patcher, but I really would like someone to guide me through the entire process. Is there anyone that can reach out to help me? richardduf@gmail.com
